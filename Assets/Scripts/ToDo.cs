/// There is a lot of things that must be done to make this a cool game.
///But there is just few that can make this little demo more interesting only by working with what we have right now.
///You can add another type of Supply. Be it creating another Supply Prefab, or making a proper Supply Class.
///Also you could work a little bit on the Level Design/Spawn Manager. 
///Making the prefab to spawn not only where there is NavMesh. 
///But in specific places that makes more design sense, like in a corner that the player must spend some time to get there.
///Also, to spawn more supplies during the game play.
///You could add a timer for each food order, and try to balance it. 
///So the player must make a decision for each supply go for each or in each order, or if is worth to just get more supplys closer to the oven, etc.
///
///If you have more questions related to games, or questions about the MsC of game at ITU, 
///or if you want some cool places to look up for game developments you can find me at marcel_barboza@hotmail.com
